  why:"Mexico open the whole tournament at a fortress where they rarely lose, and are clear Group A favourites (+100). South Africa will sit deep and counter.",
  take:{
    standfirst:"The whole tournament kicks off right here, and it's a trap dressed up as a gimme. Mexico have everything to lose at the Azteca; South Africa arrive with nothing to fear and a plan that has already embarrassed better sides than this.",
    sections:[
      {h:"How Mexico set up: Aguirre's control game",p:"Javier Aguirre is back for a third cycle and he is no romantic. Expect a 4-3-3 that slides into a 4-2-3-1 out of possession, built on control rather than chaos: Edson Álvarez shielding the back four, full-backs joining only when the picture is safe, and Mexico monopolising the ball, and 60%-plus possession is the baseline. Aguirre wants El Tri to win the game without ever being countered, so the tempo will be patient, almost deliberate, shifting the ball side to side until Lozano's pace or a Luis Chávez set-piece prises a gap open. The danger is obvious: against a deep, disciplined block, that patience can curdle into sterile possession, and opening-night nerves at the Azteca are very real."},
      {h:"How South Africa hurt them: Broos's counter-trap",p:"Hugo Broos won an AFCON with Cameroon and a bronze medal with this Bafana group by doing one thing superbly: defending as a unit and striking once. He will set up compact, two banks of four, inviting Mexico onto them and releasing Percy Tau and Lyle Foster into the channels the instant the ball turns over. Behind them, Ronwen Williams is one of the most underrated keepers at the tournament; he won a shootout almost single-handedly at AFCON 2024. Their great equaliser is the set piece; do not be surprised if their best chance of the night arrives from a corner."},
      {h:"The altitude myth nobody is checking",p:"Everyone repeats that the Azteca's 2,240m is Mexico's twelfth man. Against most opponents, true. Against South Africa, far less so. The South African league plays its football up on the Highveld, where Johannesburg sits above 1,700m, so these players live and train in thin air every week of their lives. The lung-busting edge Mexico usually enjoy is partly neutralised here, and Broos knows it. That single detail is the biggest reason I think this is tighter than the price suggests."},
      {h:"The players who decide it",p:"For Mexico it is the two ends of the spine: Edson Álvarez has to win the transition battle so they are never caught, and Raúl Jiménez has to take the half-chance a game like this hands you, because there will not be many. Keep Santiago Giménez in mind as the gambler off the bench if it is still goalless past the hour. For South Africa, Themba Zwane has the guile to spring the counter and Williams is the one who keeps them in it. The duel I will be watching most: Mexico's adventurous full-backs against Tau and Foster breaking in behind."},
      {h:"The X-factor: opening-night weight",p:"This is the very first match of a home World Cup, and that weight lands entirely on Mexico, a nation that expects, in a stadium that demands. Favourites in openers tend to tighten; underdogs play free. If South Africa get through the first 25 minutes still level, the anxiety in the stands starts to leak down onto the pitch."}
    ],
    verdict:"Mexico have the better players and they should win it. Jiménez or a set piece settles most versions of this game. But I am not buying a comfortable night. I will call it 1-0 or 2-1 Mexico with a nervy stretch in the middle, and a South Africa point would not shock me in the slightest. Lean Mexico, but hold the confidence loosely."

  why:"A genuine coin-flip for second in the group: Czechia (+260) and Korea (+290) are priced almost level. Schick's finishing vs Son's threat decides it.",
  take:{
    standfirst:"For a neutral, this is the pick of the openers. Two sides who both genuinely fancy second place behind Mexico, separated by almost nothing in the market, and a perfect style clash: Korea's speed and craft against Czechia's muscle and set-piece menace.",
    sections:[
      {h:"How Korea play: Hong's quick, vertical game",p:"Hong Myung-bo, a 2002 World Cup semi-finalist as a player, has Korea pressing higher and playing far more vertically than they did under Klinsmann. The shape is a fluid 4-2-3-1 routed through two special talents: Lee Kang-in pulling the strings from the right half-space and Son Heung-min attacking the space in behind from the left. Win the ball back and Korea want to be in your box inside five seconds, with Hwang Hee-chan's diagonal runs stretching the back line. The insurance behind all of it is Kim Min-jae, a genuinely elite centre-back whose recovery pace lets the full-backs gamble forward."},
      {h:"How Czechia play: Hašek's direct, physical plan",p:"Czechia are everything Korea are not: bigger, more direct, and ruthless from dead balls. Ivan Hašek's side defend in a disciplined block, sit a fraction deeper, hunt the second balls, and feed Patrik Schick (when fit, one of the cleanest finishers in Europe) off the shoulder of the last defender. Their not-so-secret weapon is Tomáš Souček, a 6ft 4in midfielder who arrives late into the box and is worth a goal every few games from set pieces alone. If this turns scrappy and physical, that is precisely the game Czechia want to play."},
      {h:"The battle that settles it: Korea's high line vs Schick",p:"Here is the chess match. Korea want to squeeze the game high and play on the front foot, but a high line against Schick's diagonal runs is playing with fire, and Kim Min-jae will have to be close to flawless on the cover. At the other end, Korea's pace in transition terrifies a Czech back four that is not quick. Whoever wins that single exchange, Korea's press against Czechia's direct outlet, most likely wins the match."},
      {h:"Set pieces could be the whole story",p:"In a tight game between evenly-matched teams, the dead ball is the tie-breaker, and that lever points Czech. Souček and Schick give them two real aerial threats and a clear plan B that Korea simply do not carry to the same degree. Korea have to be ruthless and switched-on with their marking; one lapse of concentration from a corner could decide the group's closest opener."},
      {h:"Players to watch",p:"Lee Kang-in is the most important footballer on the pitch; if Korea are going to unpick a disciplined Czech block, his imagination is the key that turns the lock. Son Heung-min is still the finisher and the leader they look to in the big moment. For Czechia it is simpler: keep Schick fit and Souček dangerous, and let Lukáš Provod's left foot supply the wide deliveries that matter most."}
    ],
    verdict:"I genuinely cannot separate them, and the odds agree: this is the truest coin-flip on Matchday 1. Korea's individual ceiling (Son, Lee Kang-in, Kim Min-jae) is a shade higher, so if you forced a pick I would lean a 1-1 that Korea might nick late.

  take:{
    standfirst:"Mexico versus Korea Republic is exactly the type of fixture that defines group-stage football: two sides with genuinely different needs, two styles, and only one result that keeps both firmly on track. Mexico need this to effectively seal Group A; Korea need it to keep their tournament alive.",
    sections:[
      {h:"Mexico: the host machine grinds on",p:"El Tri arrive with momentum and the Akron's crowd behind them, a different energy from the Azteca but still a genuine fortress. Aguirre's system favours control and width, with Lozano's pace stretching the Korea backline and Jiménez holding his striker role. After a smooth opener, Mexico know exactly what they need: a professional 90 minutes with the lead secured early. They are organised, disciplined, and carry goal threat from multiple areas including set pieces and wide runners."},
      {h:"Korea: Son at the crossroads",p:"Son Heung-min enters this match knowing that a second defeat all but ends Korea's real ambitions. The captain will operate in his familiar left-of-centre space, looking to drive in behind when Mexico commit players forward. Lee Kang-in, the creative pivot, needs to be at his absolute best. His ability to find pockets between the lines is Korea's main mechanism for creating chances in open play. The question is whether Hong Myung-bo's side can reproduce that attacking fluency under genuine tournament pressure."},
      {h:"The tactical chess: Mexico's press vs Korea's transition",p:"Mexico will look to dominate possession and press high when Korea build from the back. Korea counter by playing quick, one-touch combinations through the press to release their wide runners. The battle in central midfield (Álvarez versus the Korean double pivot) will determine who has the initiative. If Mexico dominate that zone, Korea are limited to set pieces and Son moments. If Korea can play through it, the game opens up considerably. The crowd becomes almost a tactical variable in itself if the first 25 minutes stay goalless."},
      {h:"The player who decides it",p:"Son Heung-min versus Edson Álvarez is the micro-battle that matters most. If Álvarez tracks Son, he leaves gaps for Korea's runners. If he doesn't, Son has space behind Mexico's defensive midfield line. Kim Min-jae will be the commanding defensive pillar for Korea. His composure and aerial authority are what keep their defensive shape when Mexico attack down the sides."}
    ],
    verdict:"Mexico are the better-organised side and the crowd gives them a real edge. Korea have individual quality in Son and Lee Kang-in but struggle when the sustained pressure comes. I expect a competitive first hour, then Mexico find the decisive moment through a set piece or a Jiménez run. My call: Mexico 2–0, though a 1–0 Korea win is not impossible if Son finds the space he needs early."

  take:{
    standfirst:"Germany versus Ivory Coast is Group E's tactical centrepiece: a European giant trying to win a tournament against an African side who have the pace, directness, and collective confidence to genuinely trouble them. Wirtz, Musiala, Kimmich. Germany's quality is undeniable. But Ivory Coast's front runners have beaten better defences on worse days.",
    sections:[
      {h:"Germany's system: high-press, quick feet",p:"Julian Nagelsmann's Germany want to dominate with the ball and press the instant they lose it. Wirtz operates in the advanced role between the lines, Musiala drifts into the left half-space and drives inside, and Kimmich provides the set-piece quality and defensive anchor from deep. When this system clicks, it is one of the most fluid and cohesive in the tournament. The risk: if Ivory Coast catch them in transition, Germany's pace in the defensive line can be exposed, especially down the channels."},
      {h:"Ivory Coast: pace, directness, and Adingra",p:"Ivory Coast's attacking plan is simple and effective: get the ball wide quickly, get Adingra and the wide runners in behind Germany's attacking full-backs, and make them pay for their ambition. Simon Adingra at Sunderland has been electric in the Premier League and is the player Germany most fear in this fixture. The Elephants' defensive compact block is designed to absorb pressure for periods and then spring on the counter. If they can stay within striking distance at halftime, their confidence grows and the second-half physicality works in their favour."},
      {h:"The decisive duel: Germany's high line vs African pace",p:"Here is the specific chess match. Germany want to keep a high defensive line to support their pressing game and maintain territorial control. But Ivory Coast's forward runners, with genuine pace, make that line dangerous to hold. Kimmich and Rüdiger must communicate clearly and maintain defensive discipline. One lapse, one ball in behind, and Adingra or Pépé are in a one-on-one. Germany's precision in this regard will be the defining variable across the ninety minutes."}
    ],
    verdict:"Germany's quality should ultimately tell, particularly through Wirtz and Musiala finding pockets in central areas. But Ivory Coast will make this genuinely uncomfortable, and if Adingra gets a clear sight of goal early this becomes an open game. My call: Germany 2–1, a proper competitive match, not a straightforward victory."

Austria are no longer the compact, reactive outfit they once were. They press with intent, they have a coherent identity, and David Alaba's presence gives them a defensive backbone that can frustrate bigger sides.",
    sections:[
      {h:"The Messi machine at 38",p:"Lionel Messi's influence in this tournament is different: he drops deeper to receive, plays the diagonal switch pass rather than the driving run, and arrives late into spaces rather than creating them from nothing. The structure around him (Julián Álvarez pressing from the front, Lautaro Martínez providing physicality in the central channel) is designed to protect Messi's involvement while creating the quality chances he then finishes or creates in the final third. Argentina will dominate possession and work it through the thirds with patience and collective precision."},
      {h:"Austria's pressing identity",p:"Austria under Ralf Rangnick are a genuine pressing side, built on intense collective work that aims to win the ball high and attack with pace. Marcel Sabitzer drives the box-to-box runs that disrupt tempo, the forward line tracks back to win second balls, and Alaba sweeps everything behind the press. Their specific plan against Argentina will be to press the build-up early, force turnovers in the middle third, and attack through the pace of their wide runners before Argentina can reorganise. If they score, they lock the structure down immediately."},
      {h:"Where the decisive moment comes",p:"Argentina will have the ball for long stretches. The question is whether they can move it with enough tempo and purpose to break Austria down before the game turns physically scrappy. This is where Rodrigo De Paul's relentless industry and Enzo Fernández's technical quality matter. They must maintain the rhythm in the face of Austria's pressing triggers. One moment of individual quality from Messi, Álvarez, or Martínez will ultimately settle it and open the game up for Argentina to manage."}
    ],
    verdict:"Argentina win this, but not in a stroll. Austria will match them physically for 50 to 60 minutes, absorb the early pressure, and manufacture a moment or two from transitions.

  why:"The match of Matchday 3. Haaland's Norway against Mbappé's France for Group I top spot. Both sides already qualified. Norway's crowd energy against France's frightening firepower, the most anticipated fixture of the group stage finale.",
  take:{
    standfirst:"This is the game everyone wanted to see at the start of the group stage: Haaland vs Mbappé, Norway's physicality against France's artistry. Both are already through. Neither side will rotate. They both want to win this.",
    sections:[
      {h:"Norway's direct machine",p:"Solbakken's Norway have one game plan and execute it with ruthless clarity. Win the ball back quickly, move it forward fast through Ødegaard, and deliver into the channels for Haaland. The 4–1 win over Iraq was the template. France's defensive line will be tested aerially and on the recovery run."},
      {h:"France's creative threat",p:"Deschamps has Mbappé at full speed, Dembélé creating from the right, and Olise as the third creative option. France's biggest advantage is their ability to press high and win the ball in dangerous positions. If they stop Norway building through Ødegaard, the game opens up for their attackers."},
      {h:"The Ødegaard question",p:"The most important individual battle is Martin Ødegaard against France's midfield press. Norway's entire build-up runs through him. If France can isolate him, Norway are reduced to direct football. If Ødegaard finds pockets and switches the ball to Haaland's runs, Norway have enough to cause problems."}
    ],
    verdict:"France win this, but not comfortably. Haaland will cause problems and Norway will make it physical for 70 minutes. Then Mbappé finds the decisive moment. France 2–1, Haaland with a goal, Mbappé with the winner."

  take:{
    standfirst:"This is the match that tells us whether Spain are truly ready to win the tournament or whether the Cape Verde draw was a genuine warning sign. Uruguay under Bielsa are not a team that gives you space or time. This is the group stage finale that feels like a knockout round.",
    sections:[
      {h:"Spain's identity question",p:"The 0–0 draw with Cape Verde raised a legitimate question: can Spain unlock a low block? Their system is built on possession, patience and Yamal's brilliance on the right, but against teams who sit deep and defend compactly, the passing can become horizontal and the chances sparse. Uruguay will sit in shape and invite Spain onto them, then spring Núñez and Valverde on the counter."},
      {h:"Uruguay's counter threat",p:"Bielsa's Uruguay are one of the most dangerous counter-attacking teams in the tournament. Valverde drives from deep with genuine pace and quality, Núñez in behind is a constant threat on the shoulder of the last defender. They beat Saudi Arabia comfortably and come here with genuine belief. The goal is to make Spain play long and slow, then exploit the space behind Spain's high line."},
      {h:"The Yamal factor",p:"Lamine Yamal at 18 is still the wildcard nobody quite knows how to solve. His ability to receive in tight spaces and accelerate past two players in a single movement is what makes Spain unpredictable against a deep defence. If Uruguay's left side struggles to contain him, the whole match changes."}
    ],
    verdict:"Spain should win but it will be earned. Uruguay will make them work for every inch. My call is 2–1 Spain after a difficult first hour, with a late goal from Yamal or Oyarzabal settling it. If Uruguay score first, the game opens up entirely."

    sections:[
      {h:"Ronaldo and the weight of the moment",p:"At 41, at his sixth and certainly last World Cup, Cristiano Ronaldo goes into this match without a goal from the group stage. The question is whether Martinez plays Ronaldo in a system that creates chances for him, or whether Portugal's best route to victory runs through Bruno Fernandes's creativity and the supporting attackers who are in better form. The captain needs this and Portugal need his best."},
      {h:"Colombia's home advantage",p:"Playing at Hard Rock Stadium, James Rodríguez orchestrating from a deeper role, Luis Díaz with genuine pace on the left. Colombia have the quality to hurt a Portugal side that has not been completely convincing. Their game plan will be to press high, force Portugal's centre-backs into long balls, and use Díaz's runs in behind to create chances."},
      {h:"Portugal's route to winning",p:"Bruno Fernandes has to control the tempo from the number ten position and find Ronaldo in the right moments. Nuno Mendes attacking from left-back is Portugal's most consistent creative outlet. If Portugal can break Colombia's press in the first 20 minutes and take the lead, Ronaldo's experience and Fernandes's delivery can see them through."}
    ],
    verdict:"Portugal win this but it is not comfortable. A Ronaldo goal would complete the story, but Portugal win it through Bruno's creativity and collective quality rather than one individual moment. My call: Portugal 2–1 with Colombia making them work for every second of it."
